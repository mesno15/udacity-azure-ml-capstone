# Azure Machine Learning Engineer - Capstone Project

This project is the capstone project of Udacity's *Machine Learning Engineer with Microsoft Azure* nanodegree. 
The scope of the project is to present the knowledge obtained from finishing the courses.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

Setting up the project in Azure ML:
1. Create new or access a workspace in Azure with your subscription
2. Open Azure Machine Learning Studio
3. Create a Compute instance so you can run your jupyter notebooks
4. Starter files were provided by Udacity, you can find them in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd00333-capstone/tree/master/starter_file)

## Dataset

### Overview

The dataset contains information about visual characteristics of cancerous cells and ground truth about the diagnosis made based on the cell data.

[*Source*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

Based on the data we can create a classification model, so if we input the visual characteristics, a diagnosis can be made, whether the cell is benign or malignant.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
